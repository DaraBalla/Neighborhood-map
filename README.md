# Neighborhood map of playgrounds

#### The FINAL Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Project created from scratch with React.

## About

The project contains data about playgrounds from [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/), especially name, city and location. The user can filter playgrounds by city. This could be helpful if somebody is looking for playground in his neighborhood. The filtered places are sorted by streets in alphabetical order, if the filter is not aplicated, places are sorted by cities.

User can click on each item in the list or on a marker to show additional information about the playground in the InfoWindow. The site accessibility is managed allowing users to noticeably tab through each of the important elements of the page.

This page is responsive and usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

#### Important:
The API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms: playgrounds near the village Velke Hostice in Czech Republic. That terms are the only terms that will work, so you probably do not find any playground near your place.
